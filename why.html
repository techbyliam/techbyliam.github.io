        <h2>Why I prefer cats over dogs</h2>
        <p>Cats are better than dogs because even though some dogs are bigger than some cats(manecoon cats is huge) they are more agile than dogs.</p> Some people mights say "Cats aren't that cool they don't even show you any affection" while sometimes that is true, dogs need a lot of attention plus they need to go on walks at least ever day cats do not. </p> Cats do require things to got to the bathroom (litter box) while dogs just go where ever they want to when they want to, weather you like cats or dogs more you still are responsible for taking care of them. </p>
